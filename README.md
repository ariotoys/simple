# simple
I don't know what's this use for and how does it works, 
I'm writing this to know what will happened if I write
in this section, as a beginner knowing how does it work,
it's worth to try. 
does anyone reading this or comment about this? is this 
a blog page or something? I'm not sure about this and 
I try it anyway. 
let's see what will happened after I pushed commit changes
GitHub read me section on master branch.
